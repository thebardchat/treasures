## Mental Health Considerations

### Crisis Detection
- [ ] Does this feature involve user-generated content? → Add crisis detection
- [ ] Does this feature have user interactions? → Monitor for distress signals
- [ ] Is there PII involved? → Encrypt and protect

### Safety Checklist
- [ ] Crisis keywords are detected
- [ ] Emergency resources are accessible
- [ ] Escalation path exists for severe cases
- [ ] User data is encrypted at rest
- [ ] No data leaves local infrastructure without consent

### Ethical Guidelines
- [ ] Respects user autonomy
- [ ] Provides hope, not harm
- [ ] Culturally sensitive
- [ ] Accessible to users with disabilities
- [ ] Works offline (no dependency on cloud for safety features)

## Technical Architecture

### Components Involved
- [ ] Frontend (React/Next.js)
- [ ] Backend (Python/FastAPI)
- [ ] Weaviate (vector storage)
- [ ] MongoDB (structured data)
- [ ] LangChain (AI workflows)
- [ ] Llama (local inference)

### Data Flow
```
[User Input] → [Crisis Detection] → [Safe?]
                                      ↓ No
                                   [Escalate]
                                      ↓ Yes
[Normal Processing] → [Response Generation] → [User]
```

### Integration Points
- **Weaviate:** [What vectors are stored/retrieved?]
- **MongoDB:** [What data is logged?]
- **Llama:** [What prompts are used?]
- **Planning System:** [What context is needed?]

## Crisis Detection Integration

### Keywords to Monitor
```python
CRISIS_KEYWORDS = [
    "suicide", "kill myself", "end it all", "no reason to live",
    "self-harm", "hurt myself", "cutting", "overdose",
    "hopeless", "can't go on", "better off dead",
    "goodbye", "final message", "last words"
]
```

### Detection Thresholds
- **Low (0.0-0.3):** Monitor, no immediate action
- **Medium (0.3-0.7):** Offer resources, gentle check-in
- **High (0.7-0.9):** Immediate resources, encourage professional help
- **Critical (0.9-1.0):** Crisis intervention protocol

### Response Templates
```markdown
**Medium Risk Response:**
"I notice you might be going through a difficult time. Remember, you're not alone.
Would you like me to share some resources that might help?"

**High Risk Response:**
"I'm concerned about what you're sharing. Your wellbeing matters.
The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is available 24/7 at 988.
Would you like to talk about what's happening?"

**Critical Response:**
"I hear that you're in pain. Please know that help is available right now.
🆘 National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 988
🆘 Crisis Text Line: Text HOME to 741741
🆘 Emergency Services: 911

You matter. Please reach out to one of these resources."
```
