Pulsar AI Blockchain Security: Minimum Viable Architecture (MVA)
The Pulsar AI system is designed to provide an actively defensive, real-time security layer for the Angel Cloud ecosystem. It shifts the security paradigm from reactive detection to autonomous threat neutralization using embedded AI models.

I. Layer 1: Hybrid Consensus and Immutable Ledger
This foundational layer handles the core transaction recording and validation.

Consensus Mechanism: Utilize a Hybrid Proof-of-Authority/Proof-of-Stake (PoA/PoS) model.

PoA: Trusted Angel Cloud validator nodes maintain high throughput and initial network stability.

PoS: Future community nodes (users/agents) can stake to participate in validation, promoting decentralization and governance.

Ledger Structure: The ledger stores two primary record types:

Transaction Records: Standard data transfer and value exchange logs.

Agent State Records (ASR): Immutable logs of every significant behavioral change, access attempt, or modification made by an Angel Cloud AI Agent or user entity. These ASRs are the primary data source for Layer 2.

II. Layer 2: Pulsar Core AI Threat Detection
The Pulsar Core is the intelligence engine responsible for real-time anomaly hunting.

Behavioral Baseline Generation: The AI continuously models the "normal" behavior of every user, AI Agent, and network node based on their ASR history (Layer 1).

Anomaly Detection Models:

Time-Series Analysis: Monitors transaction frequency, volume, and timing for sudden spikes or drops that deviate from the established norm.

Agent Identity Verification: Uses deep learning to analyze the communication style, action patterns, and resource consumption of an AI Agent. Deviations trigger a "Pulsar Alert."

Threat Scoring: Every detected anomaly is assigned a Pulsar Threat Score (PTS), which is instantly broadcast to all validator nodes.

III. Layer 3: Autonomous Defense and Self-Healing
This layer executes automated responses based on the threat scores from Layer 2.

Quarantine Protocol (PTS ≥ 75): If a node, user, or AI Agent's PTS exceeds the threshold:

The Pulsar Core instantly isolates the entity, preventing all write access to the ledger and limiting read access to only authorized diagnostic nodes.

All pending transactions associated with the entity are frozen.

Consensus Veto: A quarantine triggers an emergency micro-consensus check across the PoA/PoS validator set. Validators use the PTS and the ASR history to confirm the isolation.

Self-Healing/Rollback: If the isolation is confirmed as an active threat (e.g., a malicious agent):

The system executes a lightweight, targeted state rollback, invalidating only the malicious Agent State Records, thus preserving the integrity of the rest of the ecosystem.

The entity is flagged for administrative review and permanent revocation of its security tokens.
