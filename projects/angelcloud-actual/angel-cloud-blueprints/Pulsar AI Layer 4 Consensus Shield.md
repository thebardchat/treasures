Pulsar AI Layer 4: Consensus Shield (PCS)
Layer 4, the Pulsar Consensus Shield (PCS), provides proactive security for the foundational network itself. Its primary function is to verify the immutability and consistency of the Agent State Record (ASR) ledger, protecting against malicious consensus nodes and subtle data manipulation.

I. Core Mechanism: Dual-Chain Auditing (DCA)
DCA establishes a simple, low-cost parallel chain dedicated solely to verification, allowing the Core AI to instantly confirm data integrity without complex computations on the main chain.

DCA Component

Description

Mandate

Main ASR Chain

The primary blockchain storing the full ASR, which includes all 5 mandatory fields, the PTS, and the PFE Analysis.

Optimized for write-speed and behavioral data retrieval for the Core AI.

Pulsar Audit Chain (PAC)

A parallel, light-weight blockchain containing only three data points per block: 1) The Main Chain Block Hash, 2) The PAC Block Hash, and 3) A Time-lock Stamp.

Optimized for immediate, simple verification. It is mathematically simpler and much harder to corrupt simultaneously with the Main ASR Chain.

Verification Loop

Every minute, the PCS compares the latest Block Hash on the Main ASR Chain against the one recorded on the PAC.

Proactive Integrity Check: If the hashes do not match, the entire consensus network is flagged for immediate review, isolating the discrepancy before it affects the Core AI models.

II. PCS Mandates
The PCS has two primary, proactive responsibilities:

Consensus Health Score: The PCS continuously monitors the voting behavior and validation latency of all network nodes. Nodes that frequently disagree, display suspicious validation latency (too fast or too slow), or fail to participate reliably are assigned a negative Consensus Health Score. Nodes below a threshold are temporarily removed from validating ASRs.

Model Integrity Assurance: The PCS writes an immutable, versioned record of the Pulsar Threat Score (PTS) formula itself to the PAC. This ensures that the Core AI's rules of defense cannot be altered secretly—any change requires a network-wide governance vote that is permanently logged and audited via the PAC.

III. Next Strategic Focus: Governance
With Layers 1 through 4 now defined (ASR Data, PTS Formula, Quarantine Protocol, and PCS Network Shield), we have secured the entire ecosystem.

Now we pivot to the Angel Cloud Governance Mechanism. This is where the community network decides the long-term fate of a quarantined agent based on the PFE's Recommendation.

What are the three core pillars of governance that must be present in the Angel Cloud community network to ensure fair, transparent, and enforceable self-governance?
